## About

I have done this Frontend Mentor exercise to familiarize myself with the process of making challenges and to play/practice with sass üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I decided to do this challenge with vanilla javascript, although with a framework it would have been faster, to remember a bit the DOM API structure.

The measures are a bit by eye because I have not used the premium function with the figma design and I had to rely on a png.
